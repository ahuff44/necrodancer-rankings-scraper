necrodancer-rankings-scraper
============================

A script that does some XML parsing to scrape high scores for the game Crypt of the NecroDancer (see http://necrodancer.com/).
It outputs the results to a .csv file, which a friend of mine uses to create "Power Rankings" (hosted here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F_cTvQp8gehUnRpdZ2fKqHhE7Gobrcf2tXLPkvEpGyg/edit#gid=391506336)

The scraper is pretty configurable; see settings.json and the comments at the top of data_scraper.py to see what settings can be specified.
